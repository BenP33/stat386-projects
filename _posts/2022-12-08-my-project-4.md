In this post, I will briefly discuss the data story that can be told using a graph created from our World Bank dataset. The dataset was custom made using the World Bank API. For details on how to do this, please read [this](https://benp33.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/21/my-project-2.html) blog post. After we created a customized dataset, we did an exploratory data analysis. You can read that blog post [here](https://benp33.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/11/17/my-project-3.html). It has been a great journey, and I hope that you have learned as much as I have. To look at the different code files for each project, feel free to check at my Github [repository](https://github.com/BenP33).

Before I jump into the data story told by the graph below, I would like to clarify that it definitely doesnâ€™t tell us **the** entire story of the world, but it does tell us **a** story. It is important to remember that there are people behind the numbers in the graph, and these people (including me and you) have been drastically affected by the world events that will be discussed in the next paragraph. Each of us has a story to be told which cannot be summed up so easily, but this graph may give us insight into how we are doing as a whole.

In the graphic below, we can see the average world GDP from 2010 to 2020. Note that this is the average of each country average, so the numbers themselves may not be reflective of actual global per capita GDP. However, for this data story, I am more focused on the trend, and less worried about the actual numbers. GDP can be an important indicator showing the prosperity of a country, and countries with higher GDPs usually have better healthcare and education available for their citizens. Although this graph may be simple, it tells us an interesting story. We can see sizable declines in 2015 and 2020. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, in the year 2015, China devalued its currency, Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War, and there was a huge refugee crisis that engulfed Europe. In 2020, we know that a global pandemic started, and countless lives were affected in so many ways. This graph is simple, but it can give us clues as to how the world is progressing, and tell us a story of the world. 

Does this graph reflect your own situation over the past few years? Feel free to leave a comment below.
