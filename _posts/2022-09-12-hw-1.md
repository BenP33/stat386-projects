Can you imagine a world without the internet?

No seriously. Take a moment and imagine if there was **no** internet. Now there are many repercussions that could be discussed, and it is hard to fathom what our lives would look like, but I think the internet is something that we take for granted. In doing this homework assignment, I had to use the internet __a lot__. Although I wouldn’t necessarily consider myself a programmer, it is hard to imagine what it would be like to try to code without using the vast and varied resources on the internet. I like the idea of GitHub, where together, groups of people can make great things happen.
