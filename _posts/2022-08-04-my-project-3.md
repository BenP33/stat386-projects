## Introduction

In my last blog [post](https://benp33.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/21/my-project-2.html) I wrote about how to make custom data sets by connecting to the World Bank API. The World Bank has vast amounts of data, and there are so many different areas of the world that can be better understood by looking at the data collected by the World Bank. The data set that I made contains data with the following variables (as defined by the World Bank): net official development assistance received (current US$), GDP per capita (current US$), literacy rate adult total (% of people ages 15 and above), life expectancy at birth, total (years), refugee population by country or territory of origin, and refugee population by country or territory of asylum. The time period we have this data for is from 2010 to 2020.

This is a lot of data, and this EDA will not be able to explore all of the variables in depth. Instead, we will do an EDA for some of the questions I was curious about, and you can use the data to do your own explorations and answer your own questions! Very little of the code I used will be included in the actual blog post, but feel free to check out the complete code by going to my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/BenP33/World-Bank-Data-EDA). 

Although I will add some limited commentary, this post will be mostly pictures as we go through and visualize the data. 

## Data Wrangling

Before we start to explore and visualize our data, I want to get it a format that will be easier to work with. After scraping the data, our pandas dataframe looks like this: 

![InitialDf](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/FirstDfScreenshot.png)

I'm going to change this from wide to long format. After melting it down, we get the following:

![LongDf](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/LongDfScreenshot2.png)

We could use this, but I want each "series" variable to be in its own column. I'm also going to rename the columns so that they are easier to understand. After doing this (and removing "YR" from the year column), we get the dataframe that we will use as we start to understand our data. 

![FinalDf](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/FinalDf3.png)

Data wrangling is often half (or more!) of the battle as we try to understand the data. Getting the data in a usable format is a critical step in doing an exploratory data analysis. 

## EDA

Now that we have a great dataframe to work with, I'm going to use plots and other visualizations to understand and explore the data. First of all, I want to know what NULL values we have. We can count the number of null values in each column with the following code `df.isna().sum()`. This outputs the following:

![NullValues](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/MissingValues4.png)

We can see that each of our variables that we want to explore have quite a few missing values, especially the adult literacy rate column. This could indicate that there probably isn't enough data to get an accurate sense of what is going on in the world. As such, I elected not to do much with this data. I was curious to see the distribution however, so I made a histogram using the values that were reported.

![LiteracyRateDist](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3WorldLiteracyHist.png)

It is clear in the graph that most countries have a high literacy rate. As stated above, we should be careful about drawing conclusions from this. The countries that report their literacy rates are probably the countries that are more developed, which could mean that our data is skewed. 

I'm also curious to see if there is a relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy. I would expect them to be positively correlated, but let's see what the data shows!

![GDPandLifeExpectancy](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3GDPandLifeExpectancy.png)

Indeed, we can see that generally speaking, as GDP per capita increases, so does life expectancy.

As a citizen of the United States of America, I'm curious to see how the GDP per capita for the USA has changed over the past few years. We can see this with a line plot. 

![USAGDP](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3USA_GDP.png)

Looks like the GDP has steadily increased, and then started to drop in 2020.

Next I'll look at life expectancy for the USA. 

![USALifeExpectancy](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3LifeExpectancy.png)

Overall it appears that it has stayed about the same until 2020, where we see a what appears to be a dramatic increase.

#### Word of Caution

This seems like a good time to take a step back and talk about data visualization in general. Entire books have been written about how to properly visualize data, but these excellent guidelines aren't always followed, especially by those in the media. As such, it is important that we are also conscious and responsible consumers of graphs and visualizations. This includes taking the time to try and understand the different parts of the visualization, and asking questions regarding the data used to create the visualizations. Part of this is looking at the graph axes. Do you notice that in the graph above the Y axis only goes from 77.4 to 78.8 years? What appears to be a huge drop in life expectancy is only a decrease of about 1.5 years. Still a decrease? Yes, but not quite as dramatic as it inital appears. Let's change the Y axis and compare these graphs side by side. 

Previous Graph           |  Same Data - Different Y Axis
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![Graph1](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3LifeExpectancy.png)  |  ![Graph2](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3LifeExpectancy2.png)

These graphs are made from the same data, and are even the same type of plot, but appear to tell a very different story. Studying statistics has taught me that a healthy dose of critical thinking with a bit of skepticism is very important in today's world where we are inundated with information. 

With that word of caution in mind, let's head back to our EDA!

We've looked at the GDP per capita of the USA, but let's compare that with our neighbors to the North and South.

![GDPNeighbors](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3GDP_Neighbors.png)

There are definitely some interesting things happening with Canada's GDP per capita, and that is something that could be explored in a more in-depth analysis. Additionally, as a citizen of the USA, it makes me grateful for all the privileges we have. 

Zooming back out to the world level, let's take a look at the assistance received by countries, and the refugees by their country of origin. 

![AssistanceAndRefugee](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3AssistanceReceived.png)

Although the units of the axes are not very interpretable, I'm more interested in seeing if there appears to be a relationship. Indeed, we see that there does appear to be a somewhat linear relationship. The countries that receive a lot of assitance also have a lot of people that are leaving the country as refugees. 

I'm also curious to see how the average number of refugees in asylum countries has changed over the past decade or so. 

![Refugees aslyum](https://github.com/BenP33/stat386-projects/raw/main/assets/images/Blog3RefugeesinAsylum.png)

There appears to be a steady increase. This could also prompt further investigation!
