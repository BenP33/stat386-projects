## Introduction

In my last blog [post](https://benp33.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/21/my-project-2.html) I wrote about how to make custom data sets by connecting to the World Bank API. The World Bank has vast amounts of data, and there are so many different areas of the world that can be better understood by looking at the data collected by the World Bank. The data set that I made contains data with the following variables (as defined by the World Bank): net official development assistance received (current US$), GDP per capita (current US$), literacy rate adult total (% of people ages 15 and above), life expectancy at birth, total (years), refugee population by country or territory of origin, and refugee population by country or territory of asylum. The time period we have this data for is from 2010 to 2020.

This is a lot of data, and this EDA will not be able to explore all of the variables in depth. Instead, we will do an EDA for some of the questions I was curious about, and you can use the data to do your own explorations and answer your own questions! Very little of the code I used will be included in the actual blog post, but feel free to check out the complete code by going to my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/BenP33/World-Bank-Data-EDA). 

## Data Wrangling

Before we start to explore and visualize our data, I want to get it a format that will be easier to work with. After scraping the data, our pandas dataframe looks like this:
