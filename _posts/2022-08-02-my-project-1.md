## Introduction
As I contemplated what to write for this post, I considered the vast number of articles, blogs, and “how to” posts that I have read during my time as a college student. There is so much content on the internet, that you can usually find someone that has run into your same coding error, or a tutorial on how to do that particular thing you are trying to accomplish. As I pondered what I could add as a student entering my fifth year of college, I realized that the most valuable thing I could add was my own unique perspective and experience. As such, I decided to write a post on strategies and tips for finding a statistics/data science internship. Each of these points could be an entire blog post, but I have shortened it down to some key considerations. 

## 1.	Start Early
A lot of recruiting starts in the early part of the Fall semester. I would recommend searching a year before your desired internship date (i.e., if you want an internship for the summer of 2023 start looking during the summer of 2022). Investigate companies and make a list of where you’d like to work full-time. Then, when fall months roll around and the internships start to open, you’ll already know where to apply! Some of the internship applications don’t open until a certain date, so check your list regularly to see where you’ll need to apply.
If you can, try to determine if the application will require a cover letter. If you can write your cover letter during the summer, you might save yourself some stress of trying to fit it in with all your other homework (see tip **#4** for more about this). The following is a spreadsheet comparable to the one I used to stay organized (I provided some fictional entries for context). You might find a similar set up useful!

## 2.	Think Outside the Box
When I started my internship hunt, I wasn’t sure what type of career or company I wanted to work at. So, what did I do? I got on LinkedIn, Handshake, WayUp, and did some google searches for any internships related to data analyst or business analyst. I applied at a bunch of different places. It was free to apply, so I figured I might as well throw my hat into the ring! Yes, you will get rejected by some, and you may never hear back from a few, but hopefully by applying to several places you will not only get better at the interviewing process, but you will also have several offers to choose from! I ended up accepting an offer to work as a business analyst for a Fortune 500 company. I wasn’t sure it if I would like the strategy aspect of it, but I knew that I would be working with data, so I decided to keep an open mind and give it a shot! I ended up loving it. It was a very applicable way to use the data skills I had learned to solve business problems. 

All this to say, keep an open mind and apply to a wide variety of places, your ideal job may be in an industry that you aren’t yet familiar with!  I talked to a friend of mine who recently completed a data science internship at a big company headquartered on the East coast. He gave the following advice; “Don’t be too picky because exposure to different things is the most valuable thing that an internship offers. No matter if it’s great or terrible it will still be valuable experience”. Remember, it doesn't cost anything to apply, so don't disqualify yourself just because you aren't sure if you will be accepted. Leave it up to the interviewers to see if you are a good fit with the company!

## 3.	Prepare Well
This is intuitive! Make sure your resume is polished and relevant. If you are a BYU student, I highly recommend utilizing the services available through the Career and Experiential Learning Center here on campus. They provide excellent articles on how to write a compelling cover letter, how to make a resume, and a bunch of other really great tips and advice for being successful in your career. You can even practice interviewing with one of their employees which can be great practice. Best of all, this service is free for students! Do a little research about the company and consider reaching out to any alum that work at that company, to see if they have any advice as you go through the interviewing process.

## 4.	Establish Priorities
When I asked a fellow statistics student (who just finished a highly competitive internship at a prestigious company) what his main piece of advice would be for students looking for internships, he said the following “If you want to work in industry, realize that […] your internships are more important than 90+% of the classes you take. Plan your efforts and priorities accordingly.” This is sound advice. As college students, we have a lot that is demanding our attention, especially when it comes to classes and homework. However, an internship can lead to a full-time job offer and help you determine what type of work you want to do. It may be worth it to miss an assignment or two, or a day of class if it is necessary to help you secure an internship. Keep the long-term goal in mind and know that it may be necessary to sacrifice some small things now, in order to benefit yourself in the long run. 

Once again quoting from a fellow stats student, “Internships were opportunities for me to see which skills are actually useful in industry, and then to find opportunities to develop those skills”. Internships give students the chance to see what working in industry really looks like. It may either help you lean towards or away from certain areas, or certain types of work.

I hope the above tips have been helpful as you consider applying for future internships. At the very least, hopefully it has reminded you to start the process of looking for internships!

**Best of luck to you!**
